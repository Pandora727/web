            <h2>Parched California Misses a Chance to Store More Rain Underground</h2>
            <h3>
                Torrential rains could have helped to replenish depleted aquifers, but some say state bureaucracy,
                designed to distribute water fairly, has stood in the way.
            </h3>
            <p>
                It sounds like an obvious fix for California's whipsawing cycles of deluge and drought: Capture the
                water from downpours so it can be used during dry spells.

                Pump it out of flood-engorged rivers and spread it in fields or sandy basins, where it can seep into the
                ground and replenish the region's huge, badly depleted aquifers. The state's roomiest place for storing
                water isn't in its reservoirs or on mountaintops as snow, but underground, squeezed between soil
                particles.

                Yet even this winter, when the skies delivered bounties of water not seen in half a decade, large
                amounts of it surged down rivers and out into the ocean.

                Water agencies and experts say California bureaucracy is increasingly to blame â€” the state tightly
                regulates who gets to take water from streams and creeks to protect the rights of people downriver, and
                its rules don't adjust nimbly even when storms are delivering a torrent of new supply.
