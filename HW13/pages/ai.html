            <h2>Elon Musk and several other technologists call for a pause on training of AI systems
            </h2>
            <p>A group of technology industry executives and academics have signed an open letter calling for at least a
                six-month pause on large, open experiments with artificial intelligence.

                Companies researching AI are “locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful
                digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control,” the
                letter reads. “If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a
                moratorium.”

                The letter warns of potentially apocalyptic scenarios.

                “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?”
                it asks. “Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to
                unelected tech leaders.”</p>
